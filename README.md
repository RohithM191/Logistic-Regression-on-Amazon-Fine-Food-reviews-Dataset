# Amazon-Food-Reviews-Analysis using Logistic Regression

### Performed Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization and Text Featurization(BOW,TFIDF,AVG Word2Vec,TF-IDF W2V) for L1 & L2 Regularization.


Logistic Regression
1. Applied Logistic Regression on Different Text Featurization for Data visualization. BOW,TFIDF, Avg-Word2Vec and TFIDF-Word2Vec 
2. Used both Grid Search & Randomized Search Cross Validation
3. Evaluated the test data on various performance metrics like Roc_Auc, f1-score, precision, recall,etc. also plotted Confusion matrix using seaborn.
4. Calculated the sparsity of weight vector using L1 Regularization on BOW<br>
5. Performed pertubation test to check whether the features are multi-collinear or not

###### Conclusions:
1. TF_IDF Featurization performs best with F1_score & roc_auc score.
2. Logistic Regression is faster algorithm.
